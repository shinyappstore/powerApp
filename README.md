PowerApp is an application designed to facilitate the visualization of power curves, sampling distributions, and their intricate interplay. In statistics, power refers to the probability of detecting an effect when it genuinely exists. With PowerApp, users can delve into the complexities of power across various statistics and population distributions. The robust and user-friendly interface allows exploration of power curves for different population distributions, alternative hypotheses, and test statistics. Left panel provides a exploration of power dependencies on factors. PowerApp enables users to investigate the relationship between power and the sampling distribution of a test statistic under both the null hypothesis and the true value of Î¸. PowerApp empowers users to gain deeper insights into statistical power dynamics with an intuitive and efficient interface. Published: Stratton, C., Green, J. L, & Hoegh, A. (2021).
